# Perceptron
## First part of the program:
1. Randomize 100 points between (-5, 5) on XY graph and to categorize them with f(x) = 2x - 2 function.
2. Check if the point is above f(x), categorize it as 1, otherwise categorize it as 0.
3. Write points and their category to a *.txt* file.
## Second part of the program:
1. Read points and their categories from file.
2. Randomize weights.
3. Transform the TrainingInput values into three different arrays.
4. Train the network with input points.
5. Plot everything on graph.
## Additional info:
The program must also save the weights to a *value.txt* file and plot the graph three times:
